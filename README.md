# SPHRLOAD
In this repository, I have written an m-file and a simulink file which will generate an animation for Single phase H bridge Inverter feeding an R load. This will help the students to learn about single phase H bridge Inverter feeding an R load more deeply and also help the teachers to use the same for class demonstration.
